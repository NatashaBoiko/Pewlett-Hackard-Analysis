# Employee Database

## Overview of Project
In this challenge we need to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Purpose
Help to prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results

###Employees retiring by titles
By analyzing our outcomes from the "retirin_titles" table  we see that the most people retiring from senior engineer and senior staff positions, on the other hand just 2 people are retiring from the manager position

###Employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
According to our results from the "mentorship_eligibility" table 1549 people are able to participate in mentorship program out of 443308
